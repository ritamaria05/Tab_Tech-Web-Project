# Tâb Game

Tâb is a two player running-fight board game played across the Middle East and North Africa. This project implements the game and integrates not only Artificial Intelligence with three different levels of difficulty, but also PVP online in a school server and in a personal server. Included in its features presented below is the website's bilingual capacity.

## Gameplay overview

At the start of the game, neither player may move until someone throws a tâb (1). The tâb converts a piece from "not moved" to "moved", and only "moved" pieces can move at any number the dice gives us.

To move a piece (not yet moved) the player needs to throw a tâb. After that, that piece is "converted" and can move with any throw thereon.
A piece moves forward the exact number of squares shown by the throw. The board's layout indicates the allowed directions.
If you have no valid moves available, you skip your turn on the button "Skip turn".

If a moving piece lands on one or more enemy pieces, those enemy pieces are knocked off the board and go to the captured pieces area.

No piece may re-enter its starting row once it has left it, and cannot return to the top row if it has entered it once already. A piece can only enter the top row if and only if there are no pieces of its type left on the original row.

The game ends when one player has no pieces left on the board or when one player leaves the game; the other player is the winner.

In general, this is more a game of pure luck that it is of strategy.

## AI overview
The AI uses Expectminimax, with alpha-beta pruning on decision nodes only. It extends Minimax to handle randomness by adding chance nodes (dice).

A decision node (MAX/MIN) is where players choose moves. Alpha-beta pruning cuts branches that  cannot improve the current best result.
A chance node is randomness from the next dice throw. The value of the position is the expected average over possible dice results.

At the root, it used the current dice value. But for future plies, we use a chance node with the real stick-dice distribution (1,2,3,4,6) and their probabilities.

Heuristics used:
- Piece count lead: Capturing increases score, and being captured decreases it;
- Progress along the path: Pieces that are further along the track are better;
- Safety lanes: Squares with only up/down arrows are considered safer.


The tree uses the dice value only on its root, after that it assumes a uniform distribution on the dice. Something not well thought of is the extra roll, because that is not antecipated inside the search tree. 

```text
Root: MAX (AI with known dice value) -> enumerates legal moves 
├── m1 -> Chance = weighted average over die ∈ {1,2,3,4,6}
├   ├─── dice = 1 -> MIN (opponent) -> enumerate opponent moves -> pick one that minimizes the AI's score -> depth -=1 until depth = 0
├   ├─── dice = 2 MIN -> (opponent) -> ...
├   ...
├   ├─── dice = 6 MIN -> (opponent) -> ...
├── m2 -> Chance = ...
...
Chooses MAX from the averages of each branch.
```


Differences by difficulty:
- Easy: Doesn't search the tree. Just filters capture moves. If there aren't any captures to make, it chooses a random move. It's quick and unpredictable, but can lead to bad results;
- Normal: Uses expectminimax with DEPTH=2 (shallow depth). It uses the newest dice value on the root level, and for the levels below, models new dices with the average of the 6 possible values. It's reasonable, with some variety and low cost;
- Hard: Uses expectminimax with DEPTH=4 (deeper search). It doesn't use any randomness on the final move choice. It's a lot more consistent and strong.

## PVP overview

The PVP mode can be played locally, in the university server, and in a personal server (index.js + server folder). It applies local functions to detect valid moves and local highlights but also uses Network.js and handles the responses correctly. Each event listener calls a Network.js function, that sends data to the server, and the Update function in that script gets the new data, analyzed in the data handler of gameScript. The game works well, but you can't de-select a piece when you get to a two choice move (that will break the game LOL).


## Internationalization (i18n)
All UI strings are translated (prompts, buttons, summary, leaderboard, dice overlay). 
The language reseting doesn't reset the game. Instead, it translates all text that is on the page. 

What is i18n? 
~~~
i18n is the process of designing and developing an application so it can be easily adapted to various languages and regions without needing to rewrite the source code. It's like building a "language-ready" app. Its main goal is to separate text and formats from application logic. So instead of writing text directly in the code, we can use a placeholder or key, and the actual text is stored in separate language files.
~~~

How did we add a language:
- Add object in i18n with a respective key (with 2 languages or more, the key must be the same)
- Update setLang to include new keys if features are added

## Game summary and stats for AI
When the game is over, the browser displays a game summary that consists of:
- The duration and winner of the game;
- The game mode, difficulty and width chosen;
- The number of total turns;
- The number of moves, captures, passes and extra rolls from each player;
- The dice distribution (number of times each value appeared);
- Who started the game;

## Leaderboard
It has two parts, the AI ranking and the PVP ranking.

The AI leaderboard shows, for each player (Human, AI (easy), AI (normal) and AI (hard)), its rank, name, number of games played, number of games won and the win ratio.
The rank is sorted by the following order: win ratio -> number of games won -> number of games played -> alphabetical order.
You can also search for a specific player using the search bar.
It's possible to sort in ascending or descending order. 
You have a button now, to check the vs Player mode, where you see the top 10 best players in the server.
The data is stored in local storage, so it only resets by clearing browser data. (i.e., it doesn't disappear by refreshing ou closing the browser).

The PVP leaderboard shows, for each player registered in that server, its rank, name, number of games played, won and the ratio. It shows at most 10 players (top 10). Here you can't search nor sort.

## Configuration and UI elements
There is two game modes available: vs. AI, with three levels of difficulty (easy, normal and hard) and PvP, where you play against someone in your server. The board can have a range of columns (7, 9, 11, 13, 15), but the recommended value is 9. For the AI game, if the player wishes to start, they need to check the checkbox First to Play and the piece attributed is red. If not, its yellow. When you select the vs Player mode, the first to play will be the first to clicks on "Start Game".

## Architecture of scripts

- gameScript.js: board, turns, moves, captures, dice, AI and PVP play, summary trigger for AI and animation trigger for PVP;
- ai.js: move selection (and simulation of possible moves)
- languageScript.js: i18n and live translations
- statsScript.js: counters and summary rendering
- leaderBoard.js: sort/search and ratios
- visualScript.js: modal behaviour
- authenticationScript.js: login/register and logout
- canvas.js: handler for animations (confettis, captures)
- captureAnim.js: capture animation
- network.js: network GETs and POSTs to connect with the servers avaliable

For example, to throw a dice, the data flows in this order:
AI:
dice overlay -> lastDiceValue -> valid moves -> move -> stats/log -> summary/leaderboard
PVP:
lastDiceValue (received by the server) -> dice overlay (for visual effects) -> valid moves -> step and move -> new pieces updated and rendered

## Server Architecture

- index.js: Entry point, server configuration (Port/Public Dir), and HTTP listener setup.
- router.js: Central request dispatcher, static file serving, and API route definitions (/roll, /join, etc.).
- game.js: Core game mechanics (turns, dice logic, piece movement), victory conditions, and ranking generation.
- auth.js: User registration and initial credential validation logic.
- update.js: Real-time communication via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and connection keep-alive management.
- storage.js: In-memory state management (users/games), file persistence (users.json), and password security (scrypt hashing).
- utils.js: Low-level helpers for JSON parsing, CORS headers, and input validation.

For a user to throw a dice (POST /roll), the data flows in this order:

router (identifies route) -> game (validates turn/rules) -> storage (verifies credentials & gets game state) -> game (calculates math/updates positions) -> storage (saves stats if winner) -> update (broadcasts SSE event to all players) -> router (returns JSON result).

## Improvement Ideas
A good idea would be to actually see the AI making the move because the dice modal appears on top of the board. Instead the AI uses the dice in a more automatic way than the player and the player just sees the final move, and therefore, may get lost about where they had a piece captured etc. Another thing that we could improve in the future would be resizing the board and chat in relation to the browser's size. If the page is big, for instance when using a monitor, the board is quite small.
